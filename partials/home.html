    <h1>Balancing Priorities – The Real Value of Money</h1>

            <figcaption class="details">The invisible energies that turn our world seem beyond our control, until we stop to question them.</figcaption> <p>The value of money is an interesting concept. And getting more interesting as the years go by. The true value of money should actually not be measured in any sense of value from a monetary perspective. In today's world, too much is invested in monetary wealth. It creates imbalance and greed and allows for a degradation of the true meaning of life. True wealth doesn't come from money at all. There is something much more valuable, and often it takes years of real-life experience to stumble on the answer. The reality is that the commodity that is more precious than money or any other precious metal or any other type of wealth is – time. Ironically enough, it's also one of the only items on earth that isn't bought or sold, it doesn't exist in the markets, and it can't be stolen. Time is the true meaning of life, and the actual value of wealth. Even if someone's time is "stolen", maybe they die too early, time wasn't actually stolen, it still exists. In a different form, maybe seen from a different perspective, but it continues. It doesn't disappear, like money does. It can't be stumped by ignorance or intelligence. It can be abused or wasted, to be honest, but it still continues. So what do we as humans in this time of change and questionable leadership, have to change to value life more? What kind of use can we make of time? How can we use it to protect the world? We learn to respect it, and it will flow on its own from there.</p>

        <h1>Genetically modified foods (GMO foods) – Necessary?</h1>

                    <p>There are so many other solutions than having to scientifically alter our eatable produce. Scientists should be concentrating on other issues like saving the earth, buying us humans more time. If the ultimate goal is to allow fresh produce to be larger or last longer, then there are other solutions – buy locally; encourage more farming; sponsor local farmers markets; sponsor the building of green houses for cold climates and out-of-the-way locals; encourage communities to buy what's in season; allow the building of more compost units in towns and cities to create more compost and dirt to give to people for personal gardens; use public spaces for public gardens. These are just a few solutions which could help eliminate the need for genetically alter foods. So, back to the original question, is it necessary? Does it matter? It shouldn't exist at all, so the question itself is unnecessary. Not to mention the underlying questions that come over the simple thought of necessary vs. not – how exactly is this produce being altered? What effects will it have down the road? Is eating an extra large mango really worth eliminating future generations? I'll stick with regular-sized foods. The way they were created.</p>

        <h1>The View of the World in 2100</h1>

                    <p>I have a very particular view of the world in the year 2100, and I know it's not a popular one. I can picture a world where strength goes into care, not into empowerment. In order to make this a reality, a few key elements in today's reality need to be eliminated – mainly, wealth and religion. Why? Because in the year 2100 there is no room for war or violence. Since wealth and religion fuel the fire of voilence, these concepts need to be avoided. Work hours go into the production of renewable energies, food, clean water, transporation and communcication. The only need for armour is to protect the planet, not its individual countries or peoples. Race is no longer an issue. Starvation is a distant memory, because all countries work in partnership. Borders only exist to clarify stages of a journey. People can move freely throughout the world. The concept of money is a distant confusion, unnecessary in the world of the future; instead, work is rewarded with goods or other items. Communities work together, people share skills, produce, and equipment. Items are produced based on the immediate NEED, not kept on shelves until they are deemed necessary. There is no over-production, there is little overlap. There are huge collections of greenhouses in every country, and ways of collecting water from the ground, and saving rainwater for re-use. The oceans have been cleaned, as well as the air. The planet is respected, and the future is WORKED for, not taken for granted.</p>
